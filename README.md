# SIMPLE RESTFULL PHP API

This one was an interview test that I failed.
I decided to do it again but on my own and from scratch for the sake of getting back to the php devlopment.

## SPECS
- No framework
- PDO
- RESTFUL Url (htaccess)

## THE API
`_GET /books`
> get all books from the library database

`_GET /books/{id}`
> get specified book (by id)

`_POST /book ` ['title', 'author']
> post a new book


## TO DO
- api design
- setup config file and database access
- crud api
- tests and refactoring
